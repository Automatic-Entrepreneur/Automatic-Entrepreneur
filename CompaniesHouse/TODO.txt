- Use "requests-cache"
  This library caches requests, increasing performance and reducing probability of blocks

- Make classes async?
  Many queries are known very early so could be made early and used later, reducing latency. Be careful about overloading via "multithreaded queries".

- Rate Limit
  CH can block -- if this happens in a demo it's really bad
  Currently I rely on "it seems unlikely we'd hit the rate cap if used properly" -- but safer not to test

- CompanyInfo API change
  Currently there's no way to distinguish between a ScannedPdf and ixbrl
  So it'll stall for ages if you query a scanned pdf.
  Make this more transparent
