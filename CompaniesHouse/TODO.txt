- Finish CompanySearch
  currently only the googlesearch is done -- the CH side is unimplemented!

- Integrate PDF scanning
  Finish it off and add it to CompanyInfo

- Use "requests-cache"
  This library caches requests, increasing performance and reducing probability of blocks

- make classes async?
  Many queries are known very early so could be made early and used later, reducing latency. Be careful about overloading via "multithreaded queries".

- Rate Limit
  Google does A LOT OF rate limiting! It will block very easily!
  Both Google and CH can and will block -- if this happens in a demo it's really bad
