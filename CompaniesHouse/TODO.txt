- Use "requests-cache"
  This library caches requests, increasing performance and reducing probability of blocks

- Make classes async?
  Many queries are known very early so could be made early and used later, reducing latency. Be careful about overloading via "multithreaded queries".

- Rate Limit
  CH can block -- if this happens in a demo it's really bad
  Currently I rely on "it seems unlikely we'd hit the rate cap if used properly" -- but safer not to test
